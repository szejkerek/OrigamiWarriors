  Header: Demon Forge
  Content: 'After a glorious battle, you sail to the next island. Your eyes perceive
    a forge on a piece of land, but not a normal one; this one is ruled by an evil
    spirit, an Oni demon that exploits your curiosity.

    "Want to be bigger?
    Want to be stronger? Pay me gold, and you shall receive."

    Will you give
    in to his temptation or will you fight with your own strength? (Pay 500g)'
